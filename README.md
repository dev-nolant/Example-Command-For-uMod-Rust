# Example-Command-For-uMod-Rust
This a beginner example for beginners.

# Reason
There is a lack of tutorials on this subject. In face, there hasn't really been a tutorial video series for Rust's mods through uMod, nor Oxide in about 3 years. This will mark the start of my Youtube tutorial series on this subject, as I want to show beginning devs and people wanting start on the subject, that it's not too difficult to begin!
